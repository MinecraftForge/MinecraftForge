/**
 * This test mod provides a way to register a {@link SimpleChannel} with a different protocol version on the client and the server to cause a mod channel mismatch.
 * Additionally, this test mod can register a registry object for the dedicated server only, causing a registry mismatch. Registering a registry object for the client only is not supported, since that would not cause a registry mismatch.
 * With this test mod and at least one of its features enabled, a {@link ModMismatchDisconnectedScreen} should appear when trying to join a test server,
 * displaying detailed information about why the handshake failed.
 * In case of a mismatch, the two displayed mod versions will be the same due to not being able to specify a different client and server mod version of this test mod.
 * This test mod is disabled by default to ensure that users can join test servers without needing to specifically disable this test mod.
