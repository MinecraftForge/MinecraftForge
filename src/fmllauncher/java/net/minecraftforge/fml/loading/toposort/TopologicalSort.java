     * A breath-first-search based topological sort.
     *
     * <p>Compared to the depth-first-search version, it does not reverse the graph
     * and supports custom secondary ordering specified by a comparator. It also utilizes the
     * recently introduced Guava Graph API, which is more straightforward than the old directed
     * graph.
     *
     * <p>The graph to sort must be directed, must not allow self loops, and must not contain
     * cycles. {@link IllegalArgumentException} will be thrown otherwise.
     *
     * <p>When {@code null} is used for the comparator and multiple nodes have no
     * prerequisites, the order depends on the iteration order of the set returned by the
     * {@link Graph#successors(Object)} call, which is random by default.
     *
     * <p>Given the number of edges {@code E} and the number of vertexes {@code V},
     * the time complexity of a sort without a secondary comparator is {@code O(E + V)}.
     * With a secondary comparator of time complexity {@code O(T)}, the overall time
     * complexity would be {@code O(E + TV log(V))}. As a result, the comparator should
     * be as efficient as possible.
     *
     * <p>Examples of topological sort usage can be found in Forge test code.
     *
