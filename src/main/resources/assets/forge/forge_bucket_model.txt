The Forge bucket model supports custom textures in case the bucket model is changed in your resource pack.

There are 2 files you need to provide:
forge:textures/items/bucket_interior.png
forge:textures/items/bucket_front.png

bucket_interior represents the area that contains liquid. It can be any color, just be sure that any pixel without liquid is completely transparent.
bucket_front represents a "cover" that is put on top of bucket_interior. This allows you to put an overlay over the liquid.

You HAVE TO provide both if you want to use this feature!
