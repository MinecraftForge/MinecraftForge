     * Compatibility display test for the mod.

     *
     * The supplier provides my "local" version for sending across the network or writing to disk
     * The predicate tests the version from a remote instance or save for acceptability (Boolean is true for network, false for local save)
     * and returns true if the version is compatible.
     *
     * <p>Return {@link net.minecraftforge.fml.network.FMLNetworkConstants#IGNORESERVERONLY} in the supplier, if you wish to be ignored
     * as a server side only mod.</p>
     * <p>Return true in the predicate for all values of the input string (when network boolean is true) if you are client side,
     * and don't care about matching any potential server version.</p>
