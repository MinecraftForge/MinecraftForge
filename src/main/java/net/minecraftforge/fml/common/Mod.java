     * Marks the associated method as handling an FML lifecycle event.
     * The method must have a single parameter, one of the following types. This annotation
     * replaces the multiple different annotations that previously were used.
     *
     * Current event classes. This first section is standard lifecycle events. They are dispatched
     * at various phases as the game starts. Each event should have information useful to that
     * phase of the lifecycle. They are fired in this order.
     *
     * These suggestions are mostly just suggestions on what to do in each event.
     * <ul>
     * <li> {@link FMLCommonSetupEvent} : Run before anything else. Read your config, create blocks,
     * items, etc, and register them with the {@link GameRegistry}.</li>
     * <li> {@link InterModEnqueueEvent} : Do your mod setup. Build whatever data structures you care about. Register recipes,
     * send {@link FMLInterModComms} messages to other mods.</li>
     * <li> {@link InterModProcessEvent} : Handle interaction with other mods, complete your setup based on this.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>These are the server lifecycle events. They are fired whenever a server is running, or about to run. Each time a server
     * starts they will be fired in this sequence.
     * <ul>
     * <li> {@link FMLServerAboutToStartEvent} : Use if you need to handle something before the server has even been created.</li>
     * <li> {@link FMLServerStartingEvent} : Do stuff you need to do to set up the server. register commands, tweak the server.</li>
     * <li> {@link FMLServerStartedEvent} : Do what you need to with the running server.</li>
     * <li> {@link FMLServerStoppingEvent} : Do what you need to before the server has started it's shutdown sequence.</li>
     * <li> {@link FMLServerStoppedEvent} : Do whatever cleanup you need once the server has shutdown. Generally only useful
     * on the integrated server.</li>
     * </ul>
     * The second set of events are more specialized, for receiving notification of specific
     * information.
     * <ul>
     * <li> {@link FMLFingerprintViolationEvent} : Sent just before {@link FMLCommonSetupEvent}
     * if something is wrong with your mod signature</li>
     * <li> {@link IMCEvent} : Sent just after {@link InterModEnqueueEvent} if you have IMC messages waiting
     * from other mods</li>
     * </ul>
