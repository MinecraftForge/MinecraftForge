/**
 * VillagerTradesEvent is fired during the {@link FMLServerAboutToStartEvent}.  It is used to gather the trade lists for each profession.
 * It is fired on the {@link MinecraftForge#EVENT_BUS}.
 * It is fired once for each registered villager profession.
 * Villagers pick two trades from their trade map, based on their level.
 * Villager level is increased by successful trades.
 * The map is populated for levels 1-5 (inclusive), so Map#get will never return null for those keys.
 * Levels outside of this range do nothing, as specified by {@link VillagerData#func_221128_d(int)} which is called before attempting to level up.
 * To add trades to the merchant, simply add new trades to the list. {@link BasicTrade} provides a default implementation.
