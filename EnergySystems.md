Forge has acquired an Energy system, after many years of debate on the topic. The prevalence of the RF API has warranted the inclusion of a similar (but simpler) implementation to forge for 1.10.2 and onwards.
Those who wish to use an RF like API, feel free to use it. If you don't want to think about Energy, but know you need it, you can use it *if you wish*. If you want to interoperate with other energy systems, feel free to use this to broker with them.

Forge has always supported diversity in energy-like systems. If you have a burning desire to simulate electricity flow in all it's glory, we fully support you and look forward to playing your mod. If you wish to have pneumatic power, we have no objections, and would love to see your wonderful creations. If you have a power system of your own devising that is simply beyond our imagination, please, blow us away.
