Contributing to Forge
=====================

1) Keep patches to Minecraft classes minimal. If you need a lot of things done, you may either add to relevant Forge classes or make a new class.

2) An example mod must be provided for all PRs adding events/hooks to Forge. Whether it's a full mod using your proposed hooks, or just a pastebin containing a simple example, an example mod is required. Please also explain in detail what your new hook does.

3) Follow Forge coding guidelines (braces on newlines, spaces instead of tabs, etc)
