# Installing Forge

Go to [the Forge website](https://files.minecraftforge.net)
 and select the Minecraft version you wish to get Forge for from the list.

You can download the installer for the *Recommended Build* or the
 *Latest build* there. Latest builds may have newer features but may be
 more unstable as a result. The installer will attempt to install Forge
 into your vanilla launcher environment, where you can then create a new
 profile using that version and play the game!
 
For support and questions, visit [the Support Forum](https://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/forum/18-support-bug-reports/).
