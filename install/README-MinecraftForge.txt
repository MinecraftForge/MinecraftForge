*** HOW TO INSTALL ***

Extract the download archive directly into your MCP-directiory.
It should create a folder "forge" within that directory, containing all 
extracted files.

You should use freshly downloaded jars, add NOTHING to the jars, ModLoader 
is no longer needed. Both client and server are required and should be 100% clean.

It comes with MCP 7.2a+, but if you do not have it, you need to install the 
FernFlower decompiler, you can download it at http://goo.gl/PnJHp. 
Extract fernflower.jar into your MCP's runtime/bin folder.

Now just start the install.cmd/.sh, MCForge will install itself into the proper
locations and copy all needed files, as well as modifying the needed baseclasses.

Forge also includes a snapshot of the MCP mappings, this may not be the current 
version of the mappings. But you must use the provided mappings in order for the 
patch files to work together.

The install scripts should take care of everything for you, so you should not need
to run ANY MCP script before installing forge.
