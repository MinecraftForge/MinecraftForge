		MinecraftForge/FML@3d25b4e793c59a9131a441d6c7a2d80cac9cd701 Add in the ability to strip interface references for specific interfaces - this is probably mostly useful for scala scenarios where sythetic methods are generated and is not a substitute for using Optional.Method where appropriate. Closes #300

		Updated FML:
		MinecraftForge/FML@81fe1c9682234297443402a54e4b852ef49d0ba8 Add in an API marker for API type packages. This does several things: 1. Packages marked as API will generate a new "modid" (the provides) that can be depended on. 2. Packages marked as API will be searched systemwide, and anything declaring that package (even without the API marker) will get an implicit dependency on the API package. 3. The API package itself will get a soft dependency on the "owner" package.

Build 1.6.4-9.11.1.939
	LexManos: Add new recipe sorter that is called after all mods are initalized. This is disabled by default in 1.6 to not break current worlds as it may change machine's recipy outputs. Will enable by default in 1.7. Players may enable it in the forge config.

		MinecraftForge/FML@00c788308881a07a683e17e2e9382313f3719b45 Very significant improvement in performance by using glSubImage to upload data. Inspired by frequent complaints about performance of hires texture packs. They probably still need a beefy system but should work. Hopefully I can figure out why the subImage GL side copy isn't working properly for an even more significant speed boost. But this gets things started.

	LexManos: Small optimization for usages of Minecraft.getGLMaximumTextureSize(), only need to calculate it once.
	LexManos: Small bugfix in Stitcher that was preventing ti from fully filling the possible texture space. Should lower the amount of empty space in textures.
	LexManos
		Optimize Texture loops a bit for non-rotated textures. Should help the FPS loss on higher resolution texture packs. If it becomes a major issue we may have to look into a more  optimized animation system.

Build 1.5.1-7.7.1.632

		Pulled Biome Tag System by Emasher, Closes #433
		An issue with biome adding mods which is becoming increasingly annoying for players, is that many mod authors that add biome specific world generation or mobs in their mods, for the most part, hard code them to work with vanilla biomes only. This becomes a huge problem when it's difficult to even find a vanilla biome, let alone a specific one, when biome mods are installed.
		A simple solution to this problem is a tag system for biomes that allows mod authors to set up their world generators, or mobs to generate or spawn in biomes that have been registered with a specific tag such as "FOREST", or "FROZEN". I wrote such a system a few months ago, which I've been using with my own mods, and have made available to anyone who wants to use it. Since then, I've had requests from mod authors and players alike to try and get it, or at least similar functionality, into Forge, where other mod authors will be more comfortable using it.
		Aside from the tags, it also includes a rule based system to classify biomes that have not already been registered with it when information is requested on them (You can opt out of this by registering a biome as type "NULL"). And additionally, the ability to register IWorldGenerators for specific biomes, or biome types (tags) to speed up chunk generation a little bit.

Build 1.5.1-7.7.1.629

Build 4.2.5.299
	mehvids: Add some of the model subsystem to the server. The part that doesn't require openGL. This allows for systems that dual models as collision/selection boxes etc.

		they were before the teleport), and then complain about the player
		moving too fast when the client catches up to it's new position.  Also
		fixes this issue while riding an entity.  Only affects player
		client/server movement sync.

		chunkloading config directly in the config file, including chunk
		loading overrides if they wish (and the config allows them).
