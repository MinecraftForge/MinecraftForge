		Revert "Invalidate tile entities that are queued for removal (#5512)"
		This reverts commit 75788f63eea6c33ccef7e5cbcab27ad9ad2c2a04.
		This solution is invalid as TEs are free to modify the world
		tileEntities list, usually indirectly via chunkloading, from inside
		invalidate().
		This happens in vanilla, in TileEntityChest#invalidate, where it calls 
		checkForAdjacentChests(), which has the potential to load neighboring 
		chunks and cause a CME.
		A more sophisticated solution is needed.
