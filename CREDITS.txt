Minecraft Forge: Credits/Thank You

Forge is a set of tools and modifications to the Minecraft base game code to assist 
mod developers in creating new and exciting content. It has been in development for 
several years now, so I would like to take this time thank a few people who have 
helped it along its way.

First, thanks to the people who originally created the Forge projects way back in
Minecraft alpha: Eloraam of RedPower, and SpaceToad of Buildcraft. Without their
acceptance of me taking over the project, who knows what Minecraft modding would
be today.

Secondly, thanks to someone who has worked with me, and developed some of the core
features that allow modding to be as functional - and as simple - as it is. Thanks
to cpw For developing FML, which helped to stabilize the client and server modding
ecosystem, as well as the base loading system that allows us to modify Minecraft's
code as elegently as possible.

Thanks to Mezz for stepping up as the issue and pull request manager. He Helps to
keep me sane while guiding the community into creating better additions to Forge.

Searge, Bspkrs, Fesh0r, ProfMobious, and all the rest over on the MCP team (of which 
I am a part) for creating some of the core tools needed to make Minecraft modding 
both possible, and as stable as can be.
  On that note, here is some specific information of the MCP data we use:
    * Mod Coder Pack (MCP) *
      Forge Mod Loader and Minecraft Forge have permission to distribute and
      automatically download components of MCP and distribute MCP data files. This
      permission is not transitive and others wishing to redistribute the Minecraft
      Forge source independently should seek permission of MCP or remove the MCP data
      files and request their users to download MCP separately.
      
And lastly, to the countless community members who have spent time submitting bug
reports, pull requests, and just helping out the community in general. Thank you.

=========================================================================

This is Forge Mod Loader.

You can find the source code here at all times:
https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/tree/1.13-pre/src/main/java/net/minecraftforge/fml

This minecraft mod is a clean open source implementation of a mod loader for minecraft servers and
minecraft clients.

The code is authored by cpw.

It began by partially implementing an API defined by the client side ModLoader, authored by Risugami.
http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/75440-
This support has been dropped as of Minecraft release 1.7, as Risugami no longer maintains ModLoader.

It also contains suggestions and hints and generous helpings of code from LexManos, author of MinecraftForge.
http://www.minecraftforge.net/

Additionally, it contains an implementation of topological sort based on that published at
http://keithschwarz.com/interesting/code/?dir=topological-sort

It also contains code from the Maven project for performing versioned dependency resolution.
https://maven.apache.org/

It also contains a partial repackaging of the javaxdelta library from SourceForge with credit to it's authors.

Forge Mod Loader downloads components from the Minecraft Coder Pack with kind permission from the MCP team.
