# How to install Forge: For Players

Go to [the Forge website](http://files.minecraftforge.net)
 and select the minecraft version you wish to get forge for from the list.

You can download the installer for the *Recommended Build* or the
 *Latest build* there. Latest builds may have newer features but may be
 more unstable as a result. The installer will attempt to install forge
 into your vanilla launcher environment, where you can then create a new
 profile using that version and play the game!
