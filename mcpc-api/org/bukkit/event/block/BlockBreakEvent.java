/**
 * Called when a block is broken by a player.
 * <p>
 * If you wish to have the block drop experience, you must set the experience value above 0.
 * By default, experience will be set in the event if:
 * <ol>
 * <li />The player is not in creative or adventure mode
 * <li />The player can loot the block (ie: does not destroy it completely, by using the correct tool)
 * <li />The player does not have silk touch
 * <li />The block drops experience in vanilla MineCraft
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * Plugins wanting to simulate a traditional block drop should set the block to air and utilize their own methods for determining
 *   what the default drop for the block being broken is and what to do about it, if anything.
 * <p>
 * If a Block Break event is cancelled, the block will not break and experience will not drop.
